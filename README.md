## Nginx Reverse Proxy

I use **Nginx** as the reverse proxy server,and here are some of the configurations I used when testing locally.

``` ngnix
 upstream Starrier{
        server 127.0.0.1:3000;
        keepalive 64;
    }

    server {
        listen       80 default_server;
        listen       [::]:80 default_server;
        server_name  127.0.0.1:3000;

        #charset koi8-r;

        #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

        location / {
           proxy_pass http://Starrier;
